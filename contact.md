# Contact Us

Do you want to help build PittMesh? Let us know.

While we prefer to help interested people set up nodes to connect to PittMesh, we
also accept donations to drive our rollout. 

Our preferred donation method is Bitcoin. Our anonymous donation address is 
[1meshQDzpXUQJSdNVH7BujkudqfatFxnq](bitcoin:1meshQDzpXUQJSdNVH7BujkudqfatFxnq),
but consider sending us a message so that we can credit you somehow for your 
generousity. Otherwise, we accept WePay and can take credit
cards directly via Square. Contact us for more information on those and other 
donation methods.

META MESH is a for-profit, but bootstrapped company the beneficial community 
focus of which may lead the average person to believe that it is a non-profit. 
Unfortunately, donations to META MESH are not tax deductible.
