MetaMesh is proud to announce the addition of 16 new [Wireless Access
Points](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_access_point) ("WAPs") to
the [PittMesh](http://pittmesh.net) family! These WAPs will be located
in the Allentown neighborhood of Pittsburgh, PA along Warrington Ave.
between Arlington Ave. and Beltzhoover Ave.  This 1,400 ft corridor will
serve a community plaza, multiple restaurants and bars, along with other businesses along the route. [The Hardware
Store](http://workhardpgh.com/), a
[coworking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coworking) space serving as
Meta Mesh's office, can also be found along the corridor.

These nodes represent the first consumer-oriented deployment of the
PittMesh network, where anyone with a WiFi-capable device can connect to
them with no special equipment or networking knowledge. Simply connect
to the "PittMesh" network, open your favorite web-browser, read and
accept the Terms of Service, and you're connected!  In addition to
mesh-only services in the works, access to the Internet is graciously
provided by some of the essential businesses that keep Allentown running. Currently Sweet Peaches and the Hardware Store are providing Internet access but anyone with an Internet connection who hosts a node can donate bandwidth too!

Wireless Warrington has been made possible by a generous grant from the [URA](http://www.ura.org) and the
[Allentown CDC](http://www.allentowncdc.org/), the local [Community
Development Corporation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_development_corporation)

A special shout-out goes to [The Hardware
Store](http://workhardpgh.com/) and [Sweet
Peaches](https://www.facebook.com/eatsweetpeaches) for their support.
