[Awesome Pittsburgh](http://awesomepgh.com/) announced last night that META MESH was awarded its 24<sup>th</sup> monthly $1,000 grant for October 2013! 

Awesome Pittsburgh is a chapter of the Awesome Foundation. Trustees of each chapter award this no-string-attached grant once per month  to local projects that forward "the interest of awesomeness in the universe."

META MESH is ecstatic to be an awardee for an Awesome Foundation grant. This continues validation of our ideals and mission to bring secure, community-owned wireless access to Pittsburgh. Funds from this grant will be used to extend the network as we focus on the South Side as our first coverage area.
