## About META MESH

META MESH is building a wireless mesh network comprised of IEEE 802.11 wireless 
(WiFi) nodes spread throughout the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA area called 
[*PittMesh*](http://pittmesh.org).

Unlike other wireless mesh companies, META MESH is not in the business of 
software or hardware development. Instead, META MESH aggregates ideas from 
around the world and implements them. The *PittMesh* network is free to use and 
has no central point of failure. As long as nodes are powered, no ISP, 
terrorist organization, weather event, hacker, or government institution can 
disrupt the entire *PittMesh* network.
