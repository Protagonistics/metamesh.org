#Vision

Meta Mesh takes mesh networking technology and ideas from around the world and
implements them in a way that makes mesh networking accessible to anyone,
regardless of their technical abilities.

Our company envisions a regional, publicly owned and operated network of
inexpensive Wi-Fi nodes on or in residences and small businesses, creating a 
shared network that is open, secure, anonymous, and free to use.

Unlike regular ISPs' networks, the [PittMesh](http://www.pittmesh.net) network has no central points of
failure. As long as nodes are powered, no ISP, terrorist organization, weather
event, hacker, or government institution can disrupt the entire [PittMesh](http://www.pittmesh.net)
network.
