title: META MESH | Building the next Internet
---

# **META MESH** is building the next generation of interconnected computer systems.

META MESH will construct a wireless mesh network comprised of IEEE 802.11 
wireless nodes spread throughout a geographical area and provide services to
this network.

Its efforts start in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a city formerly of steel, now a 
city of *ideas*. Our idea is not original, but we aim to be the most successful.
