title: META MESH | Building the next Internet
---
# META MESH is building a wireless mesh network in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

**What is a mesh network?** Most of us have a home Internet connection to an
Internet Service Provider (ISP) such as Verizon or Comcast. To communicate with
each other, all our network traffic must go through these ISPs &mdash; even if 
the person to whom we are sending an e-mail lives across the street. This
centralized way of networking presents many security and privacy problems.

A *mesh network* cuts out that centralized middleman. Instead of traffic having
to go to a big server hundreds of miles away, a mesh network's traffic is routed
by the shortest and fastest possible path. 

META MESH is building a network of
wireless routers to make this model of networking a reality in the Pittsburgh
area. That network is aptly named [**PittMesh**](http://pittmesh.org). We don't 
use expensive equipment to make this happen- in fact we've designed our network
so that anyone can join it with consumer-grade, off-the-shelf Wi-Fi hardware
available at any electronics store. When you join the PittMesh Nework, you not 
only gain access to all the resources and anonymity that an "off-the-grid" 
network affords, but you expand the network, allowing others to connect and 
expand the network even further.
